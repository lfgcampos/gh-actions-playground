# gh-actions-playground
The idea of this repo is to play with different gh-actions before using them on a real project.

The goal of the first automation is to create a release notes as soon as we close a Milestone.

The release notes is created using the [release-notes-generator-action](https://github.com/Decathlon/release-notes-generator-action) from Decathlon paired with the [create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release) default action from GitHub.

You can look at the `.github` folder for more info.
